# Presets & apps

Boykisser Linux comes with a sensible base, and easy ways to add or remove the rest.

## App bundles (installer)

While installing, you can tick optional bundles — **Gaming**, **Streaming**, **Development**, **Office** — and they'll be set up before the first boot. Skipped one? Everything below is available afterwards too.

## Flatpak presets

`boykisser presets` (or the tile in the Boykisser Center) installs curated Flatpak groups from Flathub:

- 🎨 **Art** — drawing and creative tools
- 💬 **Social** — chat and social apps
- 📄 **Office** — documents and productivity
- 🎵 **Music** — players and audio tools

Pick as many as you like in the checklist, or go direct:

```bash
boykisser presets music
```

## Choosing a browser

```bash
boykisser browser
```

Offers Firefox (default), LibreWolf, Brave and Chromium — LibreWolf and Brave come from Flathub, the rest from Debian.

## Removing stuff (debloat)

Not everyone wants Steam or OBS preinstalled:

```bash
boykisser debloat
```

It only offers groups that are actually installed — gaming, OBS, VLC, VS Code, games — and purges what you tick.

## Anything else

It's plain Debian underneath, so `apt`, `flatpak`, GNOME Software-style stores, whatever you like — all work exactly as expected.
